# Phising-Classifier

# README for Phishing Classifier Project

## Project Overview
The Phishing Classifier is a machine learning-based tool designed to identify and classify phishing emails. Utilizing advanced algorithms and natural language processing techniques, this tool aims to enhance cybersecurity measures by detecting potential phishing threats in email communications.

## Features
- **Phishing Detection:** Accurately identifies potential phishing emails.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Leverages state-of-the-art ML models for classification.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive for easy interaction.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Processes emails in real-time for immediate classification.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
- Email Parsing Libraries (e.g., Python's `email` package)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Install necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```
3. Ensure your email dataset is available in the project directory, preferably in a CSV or JSON format.

## Running the Application
1. Change to the project's root directory.
2. Execute the main script to start the classifier:
   ```bash
   python phishing_classifier.py
   ```
3. The classifier will now be running and ready to process emails.

## Usage
The classifier can be integrated into email systems to scan incoming messages. It can also be used as a standalone tool where emails are fed into the system manually for classification.

## Data and Model Training
- **Data Preparation:** The data needs to be preprocessed for optimal results.
- **Model Training:** The classifier uses supervised learning, requiring a labeled dataset for training.
